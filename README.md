# Ally

### Ally connects your knowledge base to your LLM of choice

### This uses Retrival Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture; ChromaDB for the vector store and various LLM API endpoints for inference.

### Technologies used: ChromaDB, OpenAI, Selenium, Python, Javascript, Flask, React, Redux

## Why RAG
TLDR; we get to remain model-agnostic.

The race for AGI between Google, OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic, DeepSeek puts us in an exciting time where there's a new shiny model every few weeks. Persisting our knowledge bases in a vector db means it's easy to hitch a ride with the frontrunner, or the cheapest option, or the best for a specific use case--or even just for fun.
